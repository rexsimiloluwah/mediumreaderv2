### MediumReaderV2 ðŸŽ§
MEDIUMREADER is an app that helps you listen to articles and blogposts from multiple sources. It leverages Web scraping to extract the text from the article, and Google Text-to-sppeech APIs to convert the text to speech. The node gTTs wrapper further simplifies this process by also writing the response to an audio file. This audio file is the uploaded to AWS S3, and returned back to the reader to listen to.

### Where is Version 1 ?
The version 1 of this app is available [HERE](https://github.com/rexsimiloluwah/mediumreader) and leverages the SpeechSynthesis web APIs, however this was not very flexible a nd usable due to issues with the SpeechSynthesis APIs.
